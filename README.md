# Pep-Talk-Generator
A small C program using a 2d arrays and the srand function to make ridiculous phrases describing how awesome you are.

## Installation
Grab yourself a C compiler and slap the main.c file in there. Any old IDE on Windows will do (I think; idk man, i'm not an expert, yet).
I used [CodeBlocks IDE](https://www.codeblocks.org/).

## Usage
```bash
./Pep-Talk-Generator.exe
```
Or, you know, double click on it!
